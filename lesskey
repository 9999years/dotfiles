# `less` uses the escape key as a shortcut prefix, which is a little bit
# annoying.
#
# We can't disable ESC entirely because of ANSI escapes and other stuff (I
# think `less` uses ESC internally for some commands / bindings...?), but we
# can at least let repeated escapes get us out of a line entry prompt:
\e\e abort

# Note: If we use `--mouse`, we can scroll in `less` (yay!) but we can't use
# the mouse to select and copy bits of text through `tmux` (unyay).
