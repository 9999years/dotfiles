# `less` uses the escape key as a shortcut prefix, which is a little bit
# annoying.

# We can't disable ESC entirely because of ANSI escapes and other stuff (I
# think `less` uses ESC internally for some commands / bindings...?), but we
# can at least let repeated escapes get us out of a line entry prompt:
\e\e abort

# Support terminal color sequences:
LESS = --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS
